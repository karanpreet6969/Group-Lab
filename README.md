Group Lab - Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

How to Play

Rock, paper, scissors is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The three shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). The game has only three possible outcomes other than a tie: a player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors") but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cut paper"). If both players throw the same shape, the game is tied, and the game is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.
